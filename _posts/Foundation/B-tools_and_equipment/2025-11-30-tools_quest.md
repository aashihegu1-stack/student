## My Journey Through Computer Science 

Account creations:

    Email --> slack --> github --> pages --> OCS --> VScode

```
## Steps of setting up everything up together!:

Making repository, making issues, making accounts, publishing sites.

### Downloading everything on the computer and making the homepage/all about me:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    WT("Open Windows Terminal") --> WSL("Install WSL")
    WSL --> Ubuntu("Launch Ubuntu Terminal")
    Ubuntu --> LinuxCommands("Linux Commands (mkdir, cd, ls)")
    LinuxCommands --> Clone("Clone Project (git clone)")
    Clone --> Activate("Activate Tools (Ruby, Python, Git)")
    Activate --> SDLC("SDLC (code -> make -> test -> commit)")

```

#### What I learned in the SDLC Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    RunServer("Run Server / Start Local Server") -->
    MakeChanges("Make Changes / Edit Code Files") -->
    Commit("Commit / Save Changes Locally") -->
    Test("Test / Verify Changes") -->
    Sync("Sync / Push Changes to Remote")

```

#### Creating the all about me  

The all about me mainly focused on what I've done in life! I've focused on a wide array of things such what I've done. I mainly struggled on the images however! However, I quickly learned how to work with them. They arent my favorite thing. 

As you can tell, I really love sports! I mainly do dance, ice skating and tennis however.

I dont love studying as much but I have had my fair share in it! I did Sci Oly the longest but quit going into High School. I'm student coaching though!
